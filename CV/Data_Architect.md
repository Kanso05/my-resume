## ABOUT ME

I am a data architect with over twenty-four years of experience in information technology. My versatile skills as an Oracle database administrator, DevOps engineer, BI analyst, and data architect cover a broad spectrum of activities: system migration, data modeling, and business intelligence.

With extensive experience at renowned companies such as Sopra St√©ria, Monext, Gemalto, and CMA-CGM in France, as well as Revenu Qu√©bec, La Financi√®re Agricole du Qu√©bec, and Beneva in Canada, I master large-scale Oracle databases, cloud technologies (Snowflake), advanced methodologies (Data Vault), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

I possess deep expertise in Agile/DevOps methodologies, SAFe and Scrum frameworks, as well as continuous integration and delivery. My interest in Management 3.0 and open source technologies enriches my ability to support organizational transformations. Holding a Master's degree in Computer Science from Aix-Marseille II University, I work efficiently across various Unix, Linux, and Windows systems.

As a data architect, I bring significant added value to companies looking to optimize their systems, improve operational efficiency, or implement data migration and modeling projects.
